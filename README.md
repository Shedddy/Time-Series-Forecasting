# TIME SERIES FORECASTING OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. The technique is used across many fields of study, from the geology to behavior to economics. The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.

**Goals of this Project :**
To Implement Machine Learning in Building a time series forecasting model of Crude Oil Prices using Two Models :
- AutoReg
- ARIMA

**Source of Data :**
For this project, data from [The U.S Energy Information Administration]("www.eia.gov") was used, The Website "www.eia.gov" contains the price of Natural gas from 1994 till date(imputed daily)
