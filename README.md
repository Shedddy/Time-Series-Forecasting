# TIME SERIES FORECASTING OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. The technique is used across many fields of study, from the geology to behavior to economics. The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.
This project is into two parts, One for Natural gas , and the other for Crude Oil, and my goal for this project was to forecast daily prices of Crude oil and Natural gas.
To accomplish this, I implemented two different Models, AUTOREG, and AUTO REGRESSIVE INTEGRATED MOVING AVERAGE(ARIMA). The best performing model for both Natural gas and Crude oil Forecasting resulted in a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of about 2.3% and 1.4% respectively, that Is, an Accuracy of about 97.3% and 98.6% Respectively

**Goals of this Project :**
To Implement Machine Learning in Building a time series forecasting model of Crude Oil and Natural gas Prices using Two Models :
- AutoReg
- ARIMA

**Source of Data :**
For this project, data from [The U.S Energy Information Administration]("www.eia.gov") was used, The Website "www.eia.gov" contains the price of Crude oil and Natural gas from 1994 till date(imputed daily)
